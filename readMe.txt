I have verified:
1. Docker containers are running properly:
order_kitchen_app  -> PHP 8.3 container
order_kitchen_db   -> PostgreSQL 15 container

2. Symfony setup inside container is working:
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate  -> latest migrations applied
php bin/console doctrine:schema:validate     -> schema is in sync
php bin/console about                        -> Symfony and PHP versions verified


3. Composer is installed and working:
composer --version  -> Composer 2.8.12 with PHP 8.3.26


4. Application environment is ready:
	Database connection is working (DATABASE_URL in .env is correct)
	Ports exposed: 8000 for app, 5432 for DB
	Cron job for auto-complete-orders is set up in container
	

Docker setup Files:
a. docker-compose.yml
b. Dockerfile
c. .env (with necessary env variables)
d. cronjob.txt (if using cron jobs inside container)

How to start the app:
a. Checkout the application from repository

b. # Navigate to project folder
   cd order-kitchen	

c. # Build and start containers
docker-compose up --build -d
   
d. # Enter PHP container (if needed)
docker-compose exec php bash
   
e. # Run migrations
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

f. # Check schema
php bin/console doctrine:schema:validate


Ports and credentials:
PHP: http://localhost:8000
PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
DB user/password: from .env (dbuser/dbpass)


Notes:
PHP version inside container is 8.3 â€” matches updated Dockerfile
Composer already installed in the container
